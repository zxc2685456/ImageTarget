 * Class implementation of BEBLID (Boosted Efficient Binary Local Image Descriptor).

 * This C++ Implementation contain 2 pre-trained versions of our descriptor BEBLID-512 and BEBLID-256.
 * It can be used with any feature detector, the algorithms were trained in the
 * Liberty dataset that contains patches detected with Difference of Gaussians (DoG).
 * To re-train the method with other data sets, please contact the authors.
